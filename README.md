## 🌟 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a functional prototype of a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) chatbot. The application will feature a secure authentication system using OAuth 2.0 and a third-party identity provider (Auth0), allowing users to sign up, log in, and interact with an AI-powered chat interface. Security is a primary concern, and the project will incorporate principles of secure software development throughout its lifecycle.

---

## ✨ Features

The following features are planned for this application:

-   🔐 **Secure User Authentication**: User registration and login handled via Auth0 using the OAuth 2.0 protocol.
-   👤 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Differentiated permissions for standard users and administrators.
-   💬 **Interactive Chat Interface**: A clean and simple front-end for users to interact with the chatbot.
-   🧠 **AI Integration (Future)**: Backend logic to process user input and generate responses using a language model.
-   🛡️ **Secure Session Management**: Implementation of secure, server-side session handling.

---

## 💻 Technology Stack

-   **Backend**: Python 3.10+, Flask
-   **Authentication**: Auth0 (OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect)
-   **Database**: Flask-SQLAlchemy (with SQLite for development)
-   **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (initially without a major framework)
-   **Deployment (TBD)**: Docker

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.10 or later
-   `pip` and `venv`
-   An active Auth0 account

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/saas-chatbot-prototype.git](https://github.com/your-username/saas-chatbot-prototype.git)
    cd saas-chatbot-prototype
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    *For Linux/macOS:*
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    *For Windows:*
    ```sh
    py -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install the required packages:**
    *(Note: The `requirements.txt` file will be created in a future step)*
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

The application requires several environment variables for configuration, particularly for connecting to Auth0.

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory.
2.  Add the following variables to your `.env` file, replacing the placeholder values with your actual credentials from the Auth0 dashboard:
    ```ini
    # Flask Configuration
    SECRET_KEY='a_very_strong_and_random_secret_key_here'
    FLASK_ENV='development'

    # Auth0 Configuration
    AUTH0_CLIENT_ID='YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID'
    AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET='YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET'
    AUTH0_DOMAIN='your-tenant.us.auth0.com'
    ```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Once the installation and configuration are complete, you can run the application locally.

1.  **Run the Flask development server:**
    ```sh
    flask run
    ```
2.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. You should see the application's home page with an option to log in.

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

As a security-focused project, the following areas will be given special attention:

-   **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure implementation of OAuth 2.0 to prevent token leakage or misuse. All sensitive endpoints will be protected.
-   **Session Management**: Protection against session fixation and hijacking.
-   **Input Validation**: Sanitization of all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS).
-   **Secure Dependencies**: Regular review of third-party libraries for known vulnerabilities.
-   **Secure Logging**: Logging security-relevant events without exposing sensitive information.

---

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap

-   **Phase 1 (Setup)**: Basic Flask app and Auth0 integration. *(Current)*
-   **Phase 2 (Core Features)**: Develop the chat interface and user session management.
-   **Phase 3 (AI Integration)**: Connect the backend to a language model to provide chat functionality.
-   **Phase 4 (Security Hardening)**: Conduct a security review, add rate limiting, and implement robust logging.
